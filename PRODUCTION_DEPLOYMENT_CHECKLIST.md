## 🌐 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Code Upload
```bash
# Upload all files to production server
# Recommended: Use Git deployment or FTP/SFTP
# Ensure all dependencies are included
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
**Required environment variables in production:**
```bash
# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=app-101-45e45
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./firebase-service-account.json
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=app-101-45e45

# Firebase Client SDK
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=app-101-45e45.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=app-101-45e45.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=780125915934
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:780125915934:web:27baa6792ead08c661570f

# Production Settings
NODE_ENV=production
USE_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR=false  # Ensure emulator is disabled

# Other existing environment variables...
```

### 3. Firebase Service Account
**Upload securely:**
- ✅ Upload `firebase-service-account.json` to production server
- ✅ Set proper file permissions (600 - read/write for owner only)
- ✅ Verify path matches `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

### 4. Build and Start
```bash
# On production server:
npm install --production
npm run build
npm start

# Or use PM2 for process management:
pm2 start npm --name "pos-app" -- start
```

### 5. Server Cron Jobs Setup
**Configure server-side cron jobs to call the endpoints:**

```bash
# Edit crontab: crontab -e
# Add these lines:

# Run 10-minute sync every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-10min >/dev/null 2>&1

# Run hourly sync every hour at minute 5
5 * * * * curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-hourly >/dev/null 2>&1

# Optional: Add logging
*/10 * * * * curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-10min >> /var/log/takealot-10min.log 2>&1
5 * * * * curl -X GET https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-hourly >> /var/log/takealot-hourly.log 2>&1
```

## 🧪 POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# Test main endpoints:
curl https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-10min
curl https://your-domain.com/api/cron/takealot-robust-hourly

# Expected responses:
# {"success":true,"message":"No enabled ... integrations found","processed":0}
# OR
# {"success":true,"message":"Successfully processed X integration(s)","processed":X}
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Access
- ✅ Access: https://your-domain.com/admin
- ✅ Login with admin credentials
- ✅ Navigate to Takealot integrations
- ✅ Verify all UI components load correctly

### 3. Integration Setup Test
- ✅ Create a test Takealot integration
- ✅ Test API connection
- ✅ Configure sync preferences
- ✅ Enable at least one strategy
- ✅ Save preferences successfully

### 4. Cron Job Verification
- ✅ Wait for next cron cycle (max 10 minutes)
- ✅ Check API Call Logs for new entries
- ✅ Verify successful sync operations
- ✅ Monitor server logs for any errors

---

## 📊 MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### 1. Set up Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor cron job logs:
tail -f /var/log/takealot-10min.log
tail -f /var/log/takealot-hourly.log

# Monitor application logs:
pm2 logs pos-app

# Monitor server resources:
htop
df -h  # Disk usage
free -h  # Memory usage
```

### 2. Database Monitoring
- ✅ Monitor Firestore usage and billing
- ✅ Check for data growth patterns
- ✅ Verify no duplicate records created
- ✅ Monitor query performance

### 3. Performance Optimization
- ✅ Monitor sync operation duration
- ✅ Adjust batch sizes if needed
- ✅ Optimize database queries
- ✅ Scale server resources as required
