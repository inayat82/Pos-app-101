# DEPLOYMENT NEEDED - CRON JOB FIXES

## Status: Cron Jobs Need Latest Code Deployment

### ✅ WORKING:
- Hourly Robust Sync (processing 1 integration successfully)
- Logs are being saved to Firestore `takealotSyncLogs` collection
- Settings page sync strategy preferences are functional

### ❌ NEEDS DEPLOYMENT:
1. **Daily Robust Sync** - 504 Gateway Timeout (FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT)
2. **Weekly Robust Sync** - Not responding (likely same timeout issue)  
3. **Product Metrics Calculation** - 403 Forbidden error

## ROOT CAUSE:
The current live deployment doesn't have the latest cron job code changes. The functions are timing out because they're using older, less optimized code.

## DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:

### 1. Deploy Latest Code to Vercel
```bash
# Deploy the current codebase with latest cron job fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy latest cron job fixes with timeout optimizations"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
- ✅ FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID
- ✅ FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY  
- ✅ FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL
- ✅ CRON_SECRET (for authentication)

### 3. Test After Deployment
```bash
# Run test script after deployment
node scripts/test-live-cron-jobs.js
```

### 4. Monitor Vercel Function Logs
- Check Vercel dashboard for function execution logs
- Verify timeout limits are sufficient (current: 30 seconds)

## EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
- ✅ All cron jobs should return JSON responses
- ✅ Logs saved to `takealotSyncLogs` collection  
- ✅ No more 504 timeout errors
- ✅ Product metrics calculation should work

## FILES THAT NEED DEPLOYMENT:
- `src/app/api/cron/takealot-robust-daily/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cron/takealot-robust-weekly/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cron/calculate-product-metrics/route.ts`
- `vercel.json` (cron job configurations)
- All supporting libraries and utilities

## CONFIRMATION:
✅ **Settings page > Sync Strategy Preferences > App DOES save all logs for cron jobs from server**

The logging system is fully implemented and working as confirmed by the successful hourly cron job execution.
